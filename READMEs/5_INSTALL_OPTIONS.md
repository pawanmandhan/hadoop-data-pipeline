#INSTALL OPTIONS

## INSTALL STEPS

At high level, here are the steps 

* Get the source code ( git clone <repo-url> ) on sandbox VM. This demo assumes that the code is checked out in /app
```
mkdir /app
cd /app
git clone https://github.com/sainib/hadoop-data-pipeline.git
```
* Install the demo (See two install options below)
* Configure it 
* Run it 

```
Note: There are two ways to install and configure. 
	1. Follow the step by step instructions to install it  ( if you want to learn the nitty gritty of this demo ) 
	2. Use the scripts in hadoop-data-pipeline/scripts directory ( if you want to set it up quickly ) 
```
