#Atlas Integration

[Apache Atlas](http://www.hortonworks.com/hadoop/atlas) empowers enterprises to effectively and efficiently address their compliance requirements through a scalable set of core governance services.

This data pipeline demo can be configured to run with or without integration with Atlas. 

When integrated demo is installed, you would be able to see data lineage (like shown below), on Atlas after the Falcon demo runs successfully.
