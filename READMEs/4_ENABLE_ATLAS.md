#Atlas Integration to the Falcon Demo

## Concept

The idea here is to be able to see the hive lineage of the data processing taking place in the workflow within Atlas. 

## Setup 

Before setting up the Hive tables for the falcon workflow, it is essential to ensure that Atlas is setup and is up/running to ensure that 
the table definitions are captured in Atlas before the processing starts. 

. Setup Atlas hook for Hive (See instructions below)
. Ensure you are able to see Atlas UI
. ONLY FOR NEW DEMO ON SANDBOX - Cleanup the Atlas sample / seed data (See instructions below)
